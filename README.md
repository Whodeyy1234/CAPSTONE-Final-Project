# CAPSTONE-Final-Project
Final project in MATLAB for PLTW CAPSTONE senior class

The goal of this project was to appeal to the 14 engineering grand challenges. 
This specific project was chosen to propose a solution to restore and improve
urban infrastructure challenge. This was done by creating an image processing
program that would detect ping pong balls, to be labelled as "trash", and
tell a specific point how to get to said ping pong balls to collected them.
